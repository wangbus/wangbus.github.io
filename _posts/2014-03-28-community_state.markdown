What is progress? Is it the state of people talking more? Or is it silence? The truth is, community growth is realized upon only on your own. One of the most important things I learned growing up is that to never lie, especially to yourself.

Here goes, everyone needs to step up and take a look around at what they can or cannot do. Don't make assumptions about others. Bringing back the arguments about the non-technical managers, people who "don't change their ways", and other equally crappy situations is not going to make your job any better.

Regardless of emotion, we are ALL artists in the technology industry. Working for a product is working for a goal and that goal is most of the time not completely defined.

Who wants your software? Who likes your design? How much is your work WORTH?

The real answer is -- No one cares except yourself because it's about your value in expression. You will create your best work when you want to attain the goal that drives you. Being neither positive nor negative will help. Don't be afraid to express yourself. One person is capable of more than most people think. Laziness shouldn't ever be an option.

Keep going.
