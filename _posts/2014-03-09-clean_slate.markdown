Hello world? There's no need for that.

I run [Slickage](http://slickage.com), a software company in [Manoa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manoa). In my free time, I help run a hackerspace in Honolulu called [HI Capacity](http://hicapacity.org) and play competitive video games like [Street Fighter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_Fighter).

This is a technical blog about my findings, ramblings and guidance for myself and whoever that find it useful.

Feel free to reach on me on social networks. I'm not very hard to reach on the Internet and I want it to stay that way.
